# DBank 💸 on the Internet Computer

DBank is a simple decentralized banking dApp built while learning Motoko and the Internet Computer ecosystem.
It lets a user top up, withdraw, and auto‑compound their balance with interest, all running on a Motoko canister.

## Features

- Decentralized balance stored inside a Motoko canister instead of a traditional backend.

- Top up & withdraw amounts from a clean, minimal web UI.

- Compound interest applied to the current balance based on elapsed time using Time.now() and Float math in Motoko.

- Local development setup with dfx, Webpack, and autogenerated JS declarations for talking to the canister.


## Tech Stack

- Backend: Motoko canister (DBank actor with topUp, withdraw, checkBalance, compound)

- Frontend: Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- Blockchain tooling: DFINITY SDK (dfx), Candid interface, JS agent

- Dev tooling: Webpack bundler, WSL (Ubuntu) for local IC replica


## Getting Started (Local)
From the project root:

```bash
# 1. Start the local Internet Computer replica
dfx start --background

# 2. Deploy Motoko + asset canisters
dfx deploy

# 3. Run frontend dev server (optional, for live reload)
npm start
```

- App served by asset canister: http://localhost:8000?canisterId=<asset_canister_id>

- Webpack dev server (proxied to replica): http://localhost:8080

To stop the replica:

```bash
dfx stop
```

## Next Steps / Ideas
Add Internet Identity so each user has their own balance.

- Display a transaction history and timestamps.
- Deploy to the public Internet Computer network instead of only local replica.
